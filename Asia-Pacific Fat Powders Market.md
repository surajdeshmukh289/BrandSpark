In various Asian-Pacific countries, traditional desserts like mochi, sweet rice cakes, and creamy custards are increasingly being produced with fat powders to enhance texture without the need for heavy creams or oils. The growing demand for ready-to-eat and packaged desserts has also been a key driver, as these powders simplify the manufacturing process and contribute to a longer shelf life. Additionally, fat powders are used in the formulation of western-style desserts such as puddings, mousses, and gelato, which are gaining popularity across the Asia-Pacific region due to increasing globalization and the growing trend of Western culinary influences.<p><strong>Subsegment: Ice Creams</strong></p><p>Ice creams represent a substantial share of the fat powders market in the Asia-Pacific region. The use of fat powders in ice cream production has gained traction due to their ability to improve the consistency and creaminess of the product.

They provide a solution for manufacturers who seek to create a more cost-effective ice cream product while maintaining the desired texture and flavor profile. With a growing preference for indulgent frozen desserts, particularly in countries like Japan, South Korea, and India, fat powders are becoming increasingly popular.

This is particularly important in regions where consumers are becoming more health-conscious and looking for lower-fat options in bakery products. In addition, fat powders are widely used in commercial cake production, where they simplify the mixing process and reduce the complexity of ingredient sourcing.
